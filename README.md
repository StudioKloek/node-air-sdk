# @erikyuzwa/node-air-sdk
AIR SDK wrapper for npm toolchain (updated)

This is based mostly from the [node-air-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-air-sdk) package which just 
doesn't look to be maintained anymore...

Plus I've added a few things to warrant a new package.

# Building and Installing

- `npm install @erikyuzwa/node-air-sdk`
- `npm install -g @erikyuzwa/node-air-sdk # to install globally`
