# @wazooinc/node-air-sdk
AIR SDK wrapper for npm toolchain

This is based mostly from the [node-air-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-air-sdk) package which just 
doesn't look to be maintained anymore...

Plus I've added a few things to warrant a new package. I've scoped it under `@wazooinc` to hopefully help the
community 

# Building and Installing

- `npm install @wazooinc/node-air-sdk`
- `npm install -g @wazooinc/node-air-sdk #installing globally`
